Todo (in no specific order):
	move from json to yaml, to make the substitution table easier to work
	  with.
	
	Make python file itself executable 
		(ie. zipHintCracker.py <zipfile> <subFile>)

	move from python's native ZipFile (crc-password-only) to something else
	  (that isn't czipfile), to allow for type 99 (aes encrypted) archives
